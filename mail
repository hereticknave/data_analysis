Subject: RBL SaveMax Credit Card Application Cancellation

I have applied for a SaveMax Credit Card via BankBazaar with Application number:CC07006206335.
  
Now i got a call arranged by RBL bank and BankBazaar where it was upgraded to savemax pro. The executive was speaking too fast and I was forced to press the '1' option for acceptance of the card upgrade. After that I got the SMS that I will now be charged an annual fee.

I am not going to pay annual fees of 1499 for this Savemax pro upgraded card.
Requesting you to please downgrade to SaveMax which is a free card or cancel the card if the downgrade is not possible.


Thanks and Regards,
